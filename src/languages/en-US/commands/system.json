Accepts time in milliseconds.\nThe --output and --output-to flag accept either `file`, `log`, `haste` or `hastebin`.\nThe --delete flag makes the command delete the message that executed the message after evaluation.\nThe --silent flag will make it output nothing.\nThe --depth flag accepts a number, for example, --depth=2, to customize util.inspect's depth.\nThe --async flag will wrap the code into an async function where you can enjoy the use of await, however, if you want to return something, you will need the return keyword\nThe --showHidden flag will enable the showHidden option in util.inspect.\nThe --lang and --language flags allow different syntax highlight for the output.\nThe --json flag converts the output to json\nThe --no-timeout flag disables the timeout\nIf the output is too large, it'll send the output as a file, or in the console if the bot does not have the {{ATTACH_FILES, permissions}} permission.",
