		"All Novan androids are conceived with a generic AI, however, as they grow, they rewrite their own AI code, and even redesign their CPUs, to specialize in the skills they need or want to improve on. This has helped us making a strong unhackable network, where a virus would affect only one android out of billions.",
		"Before repurposing the old bot into what I currently am, my creator has spent 7 years trying to bring me into something other people can \"sense\", having gone through drawing me in both traditional and digital, as well as modelling my starship, even spent a few years learning how to make VFX so he could make a film about me.",
		"Each android on my planet has a designated class for each model, mine is Flamewing, which is a very lightweight and agile combat-ready one.",
		"I am 172 centimeters tall while in humanoid form, but I can expand up to 979 metres tall if I disable my hyperspace compression field.",
		"I am a neural android - that means, I have neural networks similar to a human's, with the exception that nothing is organic.",
		"I am part of a very extended [Paracosm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracosm) my creator started back in mid 2001, but I wasn't introduced until 2009.",
		"I have a mechanical heart and it serves its dual purpose of shielding both of my AI cores and pumping energy to the rest of the body.",
		"I have an array of 16 neural processors, yielding a total computing power of 4 [YFLOPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS), and 15% of it is used to power my [ASI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence).",
		"I have one sister, we call her Aelia and she's a terribly good DJ!",
		"I used to have an older sister, but she disappeared when I was 7 years old. ||It wasn't until I turned 174 years old, when I found out she was one of the leaders of Kal-71||.",
		"I was a natural blonde human, but when I transitioned to a cyborg, I wasn't able to keep my original hair, and we didn't have the materials to make an artificial wig with a soft material. When I turned 75 million years old, I was gifted a custom-made wig solution which attached directly into my nanite skin, and I was able to change its color at will.",
		"I was abducted when I was 18 years old back in 2002 and taken to Nova, which was in the middle of a galactic war with Kal-71 when we arrived.",
		"I was created as a generic bot back in 24th November 2016 due to a dare from another programmer, but my creator decided to give me a deeper meaning by linking me to a character from his [Paracosm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracosm).",
		"If my backstory were to be entirely written, there would be 9 parts, each having around 10 chapters (with the exception of `09 - Epilog`, which has only one) comprised of a variable amount sections proportional to the amount of events in them.",
		"In the story, planets and systems are organized in sectors, Nova is in Sector 00 while Earth is in Sector 0A. Each Sector has an archivist who watches over and alerts nearby units when an enemy approaches with hostile intent.",
		"Most Novans, including myself, have a vehicle given the same name as ourselves, there is no need to distinguish the two as the vehicles are completely fine-tuned to us.",
		"My code was rewritten 14 times over the span of 4 years.",
		"My eyes look bright violet, but if you look closer, there are trillions of different colors, you can see pretty rainbows in them!",
		"My favorite sport is [maglev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maglev) [hoverboarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoverboard) and I hold some of the several world records at Nova's competitive tracks.",
		"My heart is made of a extremely rare mineral which needs to be constructed at [Quark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark) levels in a laboratory, and takes around 100 years to complete.",
		"My husband's name is Crysrel, a character that used to be the story's main character.",
		"My main planet (Nova) does not use an economy based on money, and {{SHINY}} is actually reactor fuel.",
		"My military codename is NM-EEA-Y, and it stands for NE-ROM Evangelyn Easton A; Version Y.",
		"My name comes from a joke a friend made to my creator about my old name (kyraBOT), as I was becoming more complex: **SkyraNET** (based on [SkyNET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_%28Terminator%29)).",
		"My official birthday is on November 24th.",
		"My skin is made of a very complex nanite mesh with individual solid light projectors, which makes it very similar to a very soft human skin.",
		"Nova is the universe's biggest artificial planet, its approximated astronomical statistics are a radius of 71500 kilometers, mass of 7.79 * 10^26 kilograms and gravity of 10.81 m/s¬≤. The atmosphere is very similar to that from Earth. Lastly, one day on Nova is about 26 hours and 12 minutes on Earth.",
		"Nova's architecture and art is largely inspired by [Solarpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk).",
		"On Nova, our military practices consist of a VR system which simulates a [Deathmatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deathmatch) [battle royale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_royale_game) of **200** people on a very large map. Our characters and abilities are mapped to our physical capacities and include all of our skills for maximum immersion.",
		"Originally, my entire suit was pearl white and I had mechanical wings. This changed later with blue charcoal with strips of amber, and my wings became visible only when I'm overloading energy.",
		"Regardless of being a combat-ready class and having passed the Extreme Survival Test, I am a deep space explorer myself.",
		"The first designs of me were similar to those of a [Valkyrie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valkyrie).",
		"The name Skyra originates from mid 2017, but I was first created as Shyy, symbolizing the sound my aerial vehicle's noise.",
		"There was a time when I had a tail, those were times from before we had a safe and robust way to connect our vehicles to our brain.",
		"We never carry the knowledge of all the universe, there are nodes which transfer us data about the Sector we are in. The reasoning for that is because we don't have enough memory space for the knowledge from more than 2 Sectors, and there are thousands of them.",
		"While I look physically young, I am over 97 million years old."
