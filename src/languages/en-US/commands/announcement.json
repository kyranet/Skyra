Well, nothing stops you from making your announcements by yourself, however, there are many people who hate being mentioned by at everyone/here.\n\nTo avoid this, Skyra gives you the option of creating a subscriber role, which is unmentionable (to avoid people spam mentioning the role), and once you run this command, Skyra will set the role to be mentionable, post the message, and back to unmentionable.\n\nFurthermore, you can configure Skyra to send the announcement as a message embed by setting the **messages.announcement-embed** option in the configuration command. When sending the message as an an embed you can exclude the mentions of any users, @here or @everyone by providing the `--excludeMentions` flag to the announcement.",
