# Skyra Dockerfiles

This folder contains all the files required to control Docker development environments for Skyra. Most of the meat of
the content is in the `docker-compose.yml` file which has the info on which images can be build and as which containers
they would be ran. In order to easily control the docker-compose file there is a powershell, `control.ps1`.

Skyra currently has the following microservices that can be dockerized:

-   PostgreSQL Database
